    # In particular, we don't make use of the provided buffers for recurring outputs (MIT-SOT, SIT-SOT)
    # These buffers include the initial state and enough space to store as many intermediate results as needed.
    # Instead, we let JAX scan recreate the concatenated buffer itself from the values computed in each iteration,
    # and then prepend the initial_state and/or truncate results we don't need at the end.
    # Likewise, we allow JAX to stack NIT-SOT outputs itself, instead of writing to an empty buffer with the final size.
    # In contrast, MIT-MOT behave like PyTensor Scan. We read from and write to the original buffer as we iterate.
    # Hopefully, JAX can do the same sort of memory optimizations as PyTensor does.
    # Performance-wise, the benchmarks show this approach is better, specially when auto-diffing through JAX.
