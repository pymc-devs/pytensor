    weakref dictionary when `compile_numba_function_src` is called with a `cache_key`.
    When numba later attempts to find a cache for such a function, this locator gets triggered
    and directs numba to the PyTensor Numba cache directory, using the provided hash as disambiguator.

    It is not necessary that the python functions be cached by the dispatchers.
    As long as the key is the same, numba will be directed to the same cache entry, even if the function is fresh.
    Conversely, if the function changed but the key is the same, numba will still use the old cache.
