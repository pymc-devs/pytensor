    """Lower XTensorVariable indexing to regular TensorVariable indexing.

    xarray-like indexing has two modes:
    1. Orthogonal indexing: Indices of different output labeled dimensions are combined to produce all combinations of indices.
    2. Vectorized indexing: Indices of the same output labeled dimension are combined point-wise like in regular numpy advanced indexing.

    An Index Op can combine both modes.
    To achieve orthogonal indexing using numpy semantics we must use multidimensional advanced indexing.
    We expand the dims of each index so they are as large as the number of output dimensions, place the indices that
    belong to the same output dimension in the same axis, and those that belong to different output dimensions in different axes.

    For instance to do an outer 2x2 indexing we can select x[arange(x.shape[0])[:, None], arange(x.shape[1])[None, :]],
    This is a generalization of `np.ix_` that allows combining some dimensions, and not others, as well as have
    indices that have more than one dimension at the start.

    In addition, xarray basic index (slices), can be vectorized with other advanced indices (if they act on the same output dimension).
    However, in numpy, basic indices are always orthogonal to advanced indices. To make them behave like vectorized indices
    we have to convert the slices to equivalent advanced indices.
    We do this by creating an `arange` tensor that matches the shape of the dimension being indexed,
    and then indexing it with the original slice. This index is then handled as a regular advanced index.

    Note: The IndexOp has only 2 types of indices: Slices and XTensorVariables. Regular array indices
    are converted to the appropriate XTensorVariable by `Index.make_node`
